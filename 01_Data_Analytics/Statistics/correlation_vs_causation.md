# Correlation vs Causation

## Correlation
Measures relationship between two variables.

## Causation
One variable directly causes change in another.

## Important Rule
Correlation ≠ causation.

## Business Example
Ice cream sales and drowning incidents are correlated,
but one does not cause the other.

## Interview Line
Always validate causation with business logic or experiments.

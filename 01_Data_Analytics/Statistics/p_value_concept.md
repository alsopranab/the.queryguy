# P-Value (Conceptual)

## What it means
Probability of observing results assuming H0 is true.

## Rule of Thumb
- p-value < 0.05 → reject null hypothesis
- p-value ≥ 0.05 → fail to reject null hypothesis

## Business Translation
Low p-value → result is unlikely due to chance.

## Interview Line
P-value measures evidence, not importance.

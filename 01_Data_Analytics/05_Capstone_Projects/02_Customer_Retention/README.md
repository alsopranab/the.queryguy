# Customer Retention Capstone Project

## Business Context
The company is acquiring new customers regularly,
but overall growth is slowing.

Management suspects:
- Customers are not returning
- Retention might be low

They want clarity.

## Business Questions
1. How many customers are repeat buyers?
2. What percentage of customers churn?
3. How long do customers stay active?
4. Which customers are at risk of churn?
5. What actions can improve retention?

## Tools Used
- SQL → customer order history
- Python → retention & churn analysis
- Statistics → distribution & inactivity
- Power BI → retention dashboard
